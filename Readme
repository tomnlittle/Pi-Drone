Quadcopter Project using a Raspberry Pi Computer. I have researched and implemented a 
solution that: communicates with SPI and i2c devices to transfer data with sensors and 
output devices; sensory information comes in the form of accelerometer/gyroscopic/magnetometer 
coordinates which are then converted to quaternion values that construct a 3D model of the 
quadcopter in space; a PID system is then used to correct the current positional data against 
the desired position (level/ forward/ back/left/right etc); a PWM signal is then generated to 
change the individual speed of each motor and hence adjust the position/velocity of the quadcopter 
in space. Using my Computer Vision project, I am currently implementing an object avoidance system
 and gesture like controls using a paired raspberry pi. The project has been programmed in C++ 
 using appropriate data types.
